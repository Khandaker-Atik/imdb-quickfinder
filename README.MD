## How It Works

- The app fetches movie data from a **custom backend API** proxy that connects to the OMDb API.  
- As the user types in the search box, suggestions are shown after 3 characters with a 500ms debounce delay.  
- Selecting a suggestion or clicking search fetches detailed movie info.  
- Loader spinner shows while data is loading.  
- If no movie is found, or if an error occurs, an informative message is displayed.
